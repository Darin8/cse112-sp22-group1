- Claudia Handoyo
  - I am a Math-CS major at UCSD. I am in my third year. I learned about cs and programming for the first time on the spring quarter of my first year in UCSD. I am looking forward to learning about software engineering in CSE 110 Here is the link to my GitHub Page: [https://chandoyo.github.io/Lab-1/](https://chandoyo.github.io/Lab-1/)

- Samuel Reda
  - I am a junior student at University of California, San Diego, who's majoring in Computer Engineering. In the future I would like to see my self working in the industry.

- Thomas Fischer 
  - I’ve been programming since I was around 8 years old, but I wouldn’t call it programming - more like copying and pasting Visual Basic scripts and seeing what happened when I changed things. I really started to enjoy programming when I realized I could use it to make games. My programming experience started with Java, and a few years later, I branched out to C/C++ to use OpenGl. I've also played around with a bunch of languages since I started programming, but I tend to use only a handful of them on a daily basis.
